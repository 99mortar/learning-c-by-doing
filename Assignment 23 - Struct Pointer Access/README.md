### Assignment 23 â€” Struct Pointer Access

In this exercise, I created a simple structure containing a single member `int v`. The main goal is to practice how to access and modify structure members using pointers in C. Three different methods are demonstrated:

- Direct access using dot notation (`test.v`);
- Access via pointer with explicit dereferencing (`(*ptr).v`);
- Access via the indirect membership operator (`ptr->v`).

This assignment helped reinforce how pointers and structures interact in memory and syntax.
