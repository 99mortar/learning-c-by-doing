## Assignment 10: Array Size and Element Count

In this exercise, create an integer array with 10 elements and then print the number of elements in the array to the terminal.

### How the code works

- An integer array with 10 elements is declared and initialized to zero.
- The `sizeof()` operator is used to determine:
  - The total size in bytes of the entire array.
  - The size in bytes of a single element.
- Dividing the total array size by the size of one element yields the number of elements in the array.
- Both the total byte size and the element count are printed.

### Key points

- Using the `sizeof()` operator to measure memory usage.
- Understanding the relationship between total size and element size.
- Basic array declaration and initialization in C.
- Formatted output with `printf`.

This exercise reinforces working with arrays and memory size calculations in C.
