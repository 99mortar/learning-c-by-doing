## Assignment 4: Calculating the Area of a Circle

In this exercise, the user is prompted to enter the length of a circle's radius. The program then calculates and prints the area of the circle to the terminal.

### How the code works

- The value of Ï€ (pi) is defined using the `#define` preprocessor directive as `PIE` with a value of 3.14.
- The user inputs the radius length, which is stored as a `float`.
- The area is calculated using the formula:  
  \[
    \text{Area} = \pi \times r^2
  \]
- The result is printed with 4 decimal places.

### Key points

- Use of `#define` to create a constant value.
- Reading float input from the user with `scanf`.
- Performing arithmetic operations on float variables.
- Printing formatted floating-point output with `printf`.

This exercise reinforces working with constants, user input, and basic mathematical operations in C.
