## Assignment 1: Hello, World!

> Just like every calm and smooth introduction to a programming language, here's a simple "Hello, World!" in C.

This exercise marks the beginning of the journey with C, focusing on something classic: printing a message to the screen.  
The goal here is to make sure you know how to:

- Compile a `.c` program
- Run the compiled binary
- Use `#include <stdio.h>` and the `printf` function

It's the equivalent of saying:  
**"Hello, world, I'm ready to code you!"**
