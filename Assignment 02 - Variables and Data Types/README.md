## Assignment 2: Variables and Data Types

> In this exercise, you will declare and initialize three variables: an integer, a float, and a char.  
> Then, print each of them on a new line with a sentence describing their data type.

The goal is to practice:

- Declaring and initializing variables in C  
- Using the basic types `int`, `float`, and `char`  
- Formatted printing with `printf` using appropriate specifiers (`%d`, `%f`, `%c`)  
- Organizing output in the terminal with new lines (`\n`)

This is a fundamental step to understand how C handles different data types.
