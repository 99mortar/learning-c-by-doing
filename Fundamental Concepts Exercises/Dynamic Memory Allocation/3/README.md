### Activity 3: Expand an Array Using realloc

- Ask the user how many numbers they want to store (e.g., 3).
- Use malloc to allocate an array of integers with that size.
- Prompt the user to enter each of the numbers and display the array.
- Ask if the user wants to add more numbers.
- If yes, use realloc to increase the array size.
- Append the new numbers to the array and display the updated result.
- Free the allocated memory using free().
