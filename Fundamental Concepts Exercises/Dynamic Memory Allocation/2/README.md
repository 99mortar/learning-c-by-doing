### Activity 2: Reverse an Array Using Dynamic Memory Allocation

- Ask the user how many numbers they want to input (e.g., 5).
- Use malloc to allocate an array of integers with that size.
- Prompt the user to enter each of the numbers.
- Allocate a second array of the same size using malloc.
- Copy the numbers in reverse order into the second array.
- Display the reversed array.
- Free both allocated memory blocks using free().
