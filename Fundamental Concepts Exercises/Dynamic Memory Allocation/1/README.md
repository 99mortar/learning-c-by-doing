### Activity 1: Sum of Numbers Using Dynamic Memory Allocation

- Ask the user how many numbers they want to sum (e.g., 5).
- Use malloc to allocate an array of integers with that size.
- Prompt the user to enter each of the N numbers.
- Calculate the total sum of the numbers and print the result.
- Free the allocated memory using free().
