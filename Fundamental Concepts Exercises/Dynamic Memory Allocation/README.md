# Dynamic Memory Allocation Activities in C

This repository contains exercises designed to practice dynamic memory allocation in C.  
You will learn how to use functions like `malloc()`, `calloc()`, `realloc()`, and `free()` to:

- Allocate memory at runtime.
- Manage and reallocate memory efficiently.
- Release memory safely to avoid leaks.

These activities provide a hands-on approach to understanding how memory works in C, helping you build a strong foundation for low-level programming.
