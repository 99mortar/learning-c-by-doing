# Back to Coding: C
> Hands-on exercises and personal solutions to master pure C.

## About
I've always been passionate about programming languages, with **C** and **C++** standing out the most.  
My first real experience with programming came through **Pawn**, a C-based language, where I developed, debugged, and sold custom systems.  
That early exposure sparked my curiosity and created a natural path toward learning C in depth.

After taking a break from development due to personal circumstances, I'm now fully committed to resuming my studies and sharpening my skills.

## Purpose of This Repository
This repository serves as:
- A record of my personal progress in learning C.
- A collection of solutions and approaches to exercises inspired by the great [Learning-C](https://github.com/h0mbre/Learning-C) repository by **h0mbre**.
- A resource for others who are following a similar learning path.

In addition to activities based on h0mbre's repository, I’ve also added **extra exercises** designed to strengthen core programming concepts and build a solid foundation in C.

## Important Note
> **Focus on Pure C**  
> This repository is strictly dedicated to mastering the C language in its classic form.  
> No C++ features, no hybrid "C+" style code — just pure, standard C.
