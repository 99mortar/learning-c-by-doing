# back to coding - C
I've always had a strong interest in programming languages, and among them, **C and C++** have stood out the most to me. My first real experience with programming was through **Pawn**, a C-based language, where I used to develop, debug, and sell custom systems. That early exposure sparked my curiosity and built a natural bridge toward learning C more deeply.

After spending some time away from development due to personal circumstances, I'm now fully committed to resuming my studies and sharpening my skills.

This repository was created as a way to share some of my personal solutions and approaches to exercises inspired by the great [Learning-C repository by h0mbre](https://github.com/h0mbre/Learning-C). It serves both as a record of my progress and as a resource for others who might be following a similar learning path.

**Important note:** My focus here is 100% on **pure C** â€” I deliberately avoid mixing C with C++ features or creating hybrid "C+" style code. This repository is dedicated strictly to mastering the C language in its classic form.
