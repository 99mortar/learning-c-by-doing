## Assignment 6: Check for Remainder in Division

In this exercise, the user is prompted to input a numerator (the top number of a fraction) and a denominator (the bottom number). The program then determines whether the division of the numerator by the denominator leaves a remainder, using an `if` control flow.

### How the code works

- The user inputs two integers: numerator and denominator.
- The program uses the modulo operator `%` to check if the numerator is evenly divisible by the denominator.
- A conditional (ternary) operator is used to print a message indicating whether there is a remainder or not.

### Key points

- Using `scanf` to read integer input.
- Applying the modulo operator `%` to detect remainders.
- Using a ternary operator for concise conditional output.
- Practicing basic control flow with conditionals.

This exercise reinforces the understanding of integer division, conditionals, and user input in C.
